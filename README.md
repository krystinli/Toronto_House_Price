## 00_Motivation 
I've been going through house search earlier this year and reading a lot about the housing market, house price, and I've been trying to understand a bit more about how the system works in general. There're tons of resources online. After going through all the articles and websites, I feel kina itchy for getting some raw data and doing analysis myself.

### What exactly is an MLS® System?
- The official listing system for properties operated by real estate Boards and Associations in Canada.
- They are accessible to REALTOR® Members of those Boards and Associations who have agreed to represent your interests and share remuneration from the transaction with a cooperating REALTOR® Member.
- Toronto Real Estate Board wanted to prevent members from releasing home sale prices. 

### How to Access the Toronto Real Estate Board’s (TREB) Data?

- The Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) recently lost a battle in court that forced them to allow their members to download sold statistics. 
- Prior to this decision, members could only access this data through their member login and in a limited capacity. 
- The decision may mean the end of a long legal battle over whether consumers should have online access to information such as home sales prices, house history and property market trends in a neighbourhood.
- TREB has fought since 2011 to keep the figures in the hands of real estate agents, arguing that posting the data would violate consumer privacy.

However, finding the raw MLS data is still not easy ... [when_are_canadians_going_to_get_access_to_mls_data](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/ayrw4v/when_are_canadians_going_to_get_access_to_mls_data/)
