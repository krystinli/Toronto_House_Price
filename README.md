## 00_Motivation 
I've been going through house search earlier this year and reading a lot about the housing market, house price, and I've been trying to understand a bit more about how the system works in general. There're tons of resources online. After going through all the articles and websites, I feel kina itchy for getting some raw data and doing analysis myself.

### What exactly is an MLS® System?
- The official listing system for properties operated by real estate Boards and Associations in Canada.
- They are accessible to REALTOR® Members of those Boards and Associations who have agreed to represent your interests and share remuneration from the transaction with a cooperating REALTOR® Member.
- Toronto Real Estate Board wanted to prevent members from releasing home sale prices. 

## How to Access the Toronto Real Estate Board’s (TREB) Data?
- The Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) recently lost a battle in court that forced them to allow their members to download sold statistics. [cbc_news](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/treb-real-estate-sale-prices-1.4795903)
- Prior to this decision, members could only access this data through their member login and in a limited capacity.
